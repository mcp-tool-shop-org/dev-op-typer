# SnippetPackValidator (optional)
A small console tool idea to validate snippet packs.
This folder includes a starter Program.cs; you can create a `dotnet new console` project and drop it in.

Usage concept:
- Validate JSON format
- Ensure required fields exist
- Ensure code ends with \n
- Ensure unique IDs per language pack
